## Part 1: Spring Boot Security
1. `Secure a REST API with JWT Authentication`
    - `Scenario`: You're building a REST API for a social media platform. Users need to be authenticated securely before accessing their profiles or posting content.
    - `Tasks`:

        ■ Implement JWT authentication in your Spring Boot application.

        ■ Users log in with username and password, receiving a JWT token upon successful authentication.

        ■ Secure API endpoints by requiring a valid JWT token in the authorization header.

        ■ Implement logic to validate and decode JWT tokens within controllers.

2. `Integrate OAuth2 with a Social Login Provider`
    - `Scenario`: You're developing an e-commerce application. Allow users to register and log in using their existing social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook).
    - `Tasks`:
        
        ■ Choose a social login provider (e.g., Google).

        ■ Configure your Spring Security application to integrate with the chosen provider's OAuth2 flow.

        ■ Users log in using their social media credentials, granting access to your
        application.

        ■ Retrieve user information (e.g., name, email) from the social provider after successful login.

## Part 2: Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring & Management)
3. `Monitor Application Health with Actuator Endpoints`
    - `Scenario`: You're deploying your Spring Boot application to a production environment. It's crucial to monitor its health and performance.
    - `Tasks`:
        
        ■ Enable Spring Boot Actuator in your application.

        ■ Explore Actuator endpoints like /health, /metrics, and /env.

        ■ Visualize application health metrics using a monitoring tool (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus).

        ■ Secure access to Actuator endpoints using basic authentication or other security measures.

## Part 3: Spring Cloud (Microservices Architecture)
4. `Build a Microservice-based E-commerce Application`
    - `Scenario`: Develop an e-commerce application with separate microservices for user management, product catalog, and order processing.
    - `Tasks`:

        ■ Design a microservices architecture for your e-commerce application.
        
        ■ Implement each microservice as a separate Spring Boot application.
        
        ■ Utilize Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management across microservices.
        
        ■ Set up a service registry (e.g., Eureka) for microservices discovery.
        
        ■ Develop APIs within each microservice for communication (e.g., REST APIs).
        
        ■ Consider implementing an API Gateway (optional) for routing user requests to the appropriate microservice.

## Part 4: Docker for Java Applications
5. `Containerize Your Microservices for Deployment`
    - `Scenario`: You want to deploy your e-commerce microservices in a scalable and portable manner.
    - `Tasks`:
        
        ■ Set up a Docker environment and learn basic Docker commands.
        
        ■ Create Dockerfiles for each of your microservices, packaging them into containers.
        
        ■ Run your microservices as Docker containers and explore container management.
        
        ■ Consider using Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications (microservices) for easier deployment
