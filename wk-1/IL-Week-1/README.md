## Implement a Design Pattern
- creating a text formatter for a text editor
- a text editor can have different text formatters
- so we will have a bunch of text formatters and pass the required one

  - to the text editor in order to formate a text

- Using the `Strategy Design Pattern`

  - A family of algorithms encapsulating one another
  - Keep the implementations of each of the algorithms in a separate class (Strategy)
  - any object using the strategy object - called - context object
  - strategy objects must be designed to offer the same interface
  - what a client needs to do is to configure the context, with the selected strategy instance
  - what do we have
    - `Strategy`:
      - declares the interface common to all supported algorithms
      - note that `context` will use this interface to call the algorithm defined by the `concrete strategy`
    - `Concrete Strategy`:
      - implements the algorithm using the `strategy` interface
    - `Context`:
      - congfigured with a `concrete strategy` object
      - maintains a reference to the `strategy` object
      - may define an interface that lets `strategy` access its data

- [Solution - ./src/main/java/frank/oop_deep_dive/labone](./src/main/java/frank/oop_deep_dive/labone)
    - `CapTextFormatter`, is a concrete text formatter that implements the TextFormatter interface and the class is used to change the text into capital case
    - The `LowerTextFormatter` is a concrete text formatter that implements the TextFormatter interface and the class is
used to change the text into small case.
    - `TextEditor` class holds a reference to the `TextFormatter` interface

- Advantages
    -  We can add new text formatters without disturbing the current code



## Leverage Inner Classes for Data Encapsulation
- Outer Class: `Rocket` 🚀
- Attributes:
    - `name`: The name of the rocket.
    - `weight`: The weight of the rocket (in kilograms).
- Methods:
    - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the rocket.
    - `displayRocketDetails()`: Prints the rocket's details to the console.
- Inner Class: `Engine`
    - Attributes:
        - `type`: The engine type (e.g., liquid, solid).
        - `thrust`: The thrust generated by the engine (in Newtons).
    - Methods:
        - `calculateThrustToWeightRatio()`: Calculates and returns the thrust-to-weight ratio for the rocket.
        - `displayEngineDetails()`: Prints the engine's details, including the thrust-to-weight ratio.

The inner class Engine provides functionality closely tied to the outer class Rocket, such as calculating the thrust-to-weight ratio using the rocket's weight.

## Create a Generic Method for Data Validation
-  what i did was a Baking Validation Utility
- Generic Validation: Supports validation for different types of data (Integer, String, Double, etc.).
- Modularity: I placed each validation logic in a separate class, improving code clarity.
- Extensibility: New validation criteria can be added easily by implementing the `BakingValidator<T>` interface.
- Structure
    - Interface
        - `BakingValidator<T>`: A generic interface for defining validation criteria.
    - Validators
        - `TemperatureValidator`: Validates if a temperature is within the baking range (150–250°C).
        - `IngredientNameValidator`: Validates that ingredient names are non-empty and not too long (max 30 characters).
    - `WeightValidator`: Validates if an ingredient's weight is within 0–1000 grams.

## Design a Generic Class for Stack Data Structure
- The class MyStack<T> uses a type parameter T, which allows the stack to hold any data type (like Integer, String, etc.).
- It uses an array (`Object[]` stack) to store elements. The array resizes when it reaches capacity.
- When the stack is full, it doubles the array size to accommodate more elements
- operations
    - `push(T item)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element.
    - `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.
    - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
    - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Implement a Thread-Safe Cache using ConcurrentHashMap
- `PhonebookCache Interface`: I defined the  operations such as adding, updating, removing, and retrieving contacts.
- `HashMapPhonebookCache`: Uses HashMap for non-thread-safe operations.
- `ConcurrentHashMapPhonebookCache`: Uses ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations.
- `File Persistence`: Contact information is written to a file (phonebook.txt) after each modification to observe the effects of concurrent modifications.
- `Multithreading`: Simulates concurrent access using multiple threads to add, update, and remove contacts.

## Process a Collection using Stream API and Custom Comparator
- `Collection of Candidates`
    - The data consists of a list of candidates running for the election, with their respective details such as name, age, party, and number of votes received.
- `Custom Comparator`
    - A custom comparator is used to sort the candidates first by the number of votes received (in descending order) and then by age (in ascending order) when votes are the same.
- `Stream API Operations`
    - `Filter`: Only candidates aged 55 and above are retained.
    - `Transform`: The candidates' information is transformed into a readable string format displaying their name, party, and votes received.
    - `Process`: The total number of votes from the filtered candidates is calculated.

## Handling Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
- Created a `Ghana Election Result Processor` class
- processes Ghana's election results from a CSV file, declaring Frank Aboagye as the independent candidate winner! 🎉\
- 🚀 Features
    - Reads election results from a CSV file.
    - Handles:
        - `Checked Exceptions`: Ensures safe file handling.
        - `Unchecked Exceptions`: Validates data correctness.
    - Outputs the election winner.
```csv
# example CSV Data

Frank Aboagye,102345
Jane Doe,98765
John Smith,54321
```

- Exception Types and Names

| **Type**              | **Exception Name**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Checked Exception** | `IOException`                   | Thrown if there is an error while reading the election results file (e.g., file not found or cannot be opened).                                         |
| **Unchecked Exception** | `IllegalArgumentException`      | Thrown if the file contains malformed data (e.g., invalid CSV structure or non-numeric vote count).                                                     |
| **Unchecked Exception** | `NumberFormatException`         | Thrown internally within `IllegalArgumentException` when parsing a non-numeric vote count.                                                              |
| **Unchecked Exception** | `IllegalArgumentException`      | Thrown when attempting to determine a winner but the results are empty or invalid (e.g., no data in the map).                                           |

## Releasing Resources with finally Block
- Here, I created a program that demonstrates how to open and display an animated GIF while ensuring proper resource management.
- The program will open a window displaying the animated GIF! 🎬
- 🛠️ Features:
    - **Releasing Resources**: The `finally` block ensures that the file input stream is closed properly, even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks. 🧹
