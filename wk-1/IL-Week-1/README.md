## Lab One
- creating a text formatter for a text editor
- a text editor can have different text formatters
- so we will have a bunch of text formatters and pass the required one

  - to the text editor in order to formate a text

- Using the `Strategy Design Pattern`

  - A family of algorithms encapsulating one another
  - Keep the implementations of each of the algorithms in a separate class (Strategy)
  - any object using the strategy object - called - context object
  - strategy objects must be designed to offer the same interface
  - what a client needs to do is to configure the context, with the selected strategy instance
  - what do we have
    - `Strategy`:
      - declares the interface common to all supported algorithms
      - note that `context` will use this interface to call the algorithm defined by the `concrete strategy`
    - `Concrete Strategy`:
      - implements the algorithm using the `strategy` interface
    - `Context`:
      - congfigured with a `concrete strategy` object
      - maintains a reference to the `strategy` object
      - may define an interface that lets `strategy` access its data

- [](./src/main/java/frank/labone/)
    - `CapTextFormatter`, is a concrete text formatter that implements the TextFormatter interface and the class is used to change the text into capital case
    - The `LowerTextFormatter` is a concrete text formatter that implements the TextFormatter interface and the class is
used to change the text into small case.
    - `TextEditor` class holds a reference to the `TextFormatter` interface

- Advantages
    -  We can add new text formatters without disturbing the current code




## Lab Two
- Outer Class: `Rocket` ðŸš€
- Attributes:
    - `name`: The name of the rocket.
    - `weight`: The weight of the rocket (in kilograms).
- Methods:
    - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the rocket.
    - `displayRocketDetails()`: Prints the rocket's details to the console.
- Inner Class: `Engine`
    - Attributes:
        - `type`: The engine type (e.g., liquid, solid).
        - `thrust`: The thrust generated by the engine (in Newtons).
    - Methods:
        - `calculateThrustToWeightRatio()`: Calculates and returns the thrust-to-weight ratio for the rocket.
        - `displayEngineDetails()`: Prints the engine's details, including the thrust-to-weight ratio.

The inner class Engine provides functionality closely tied to the outer class Rocket, such as calculating the thrust-to-weight ratio using the rocket's weight.
