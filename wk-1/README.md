### Advanced Java Features (Object-Oriented Programming, Generics, Collections Framework)

1. #### Implement a Design Pattern
- Choose a design pattern like Factory Method or Strategy.
- Design a real-world scenario applicable to the chosen pattern and implement it in Java using classes and methods.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

2. #### Leverage Inner Classes for Data Encapsulation
- Create a class with an inner class to encapsulate helper functionality or data related to the outer class.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

...

3. #### Create a Generic Method for Data Validation
- Implement a generic method that can validate different data types (e.g., numbers, strings) based on specific criteria.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)
...

4. #### Design a Generic Class for Stack Data Structure
- Create a generic Stack class that can hold objects of any data type, utilizing generics for type safety.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)
...

5. #### Implement a Thread-Safe Cache using ConcurrentHashMap
- 
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)
...

6. #### Process a Collection using Stream API and Custom Comparator
- 
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)
