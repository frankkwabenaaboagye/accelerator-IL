### Advanced Java Features (Object-Oriented Programming, Generics, Collections Framework)

1. #### Implement a Design Pattern
- Choose a design pattern like Factory Method or Strategy.
- Design a real-world scenario applicable to the chosen pattern and implement it in Java using classes and methods.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

2. #### Leverage Inner Classes for Data Encapsulation
- Create a class with an inner class to encapsulate helper functionality or data related to the outer class.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)


3. #### Create a Generic Method for Data Validation
- Implement a generic method that can validate different data types (e.g., numbers, strings) based on specific criteria.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)


4. #### Design a Generic Class for Stack Data Structure
- Create a generic Stack class that can hold objects of any data type, utilizing generics for type safety.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

5. #### Implement a Thread-Safe Cache using ConcurrentHashMap
- Design a simple in-memory cache using ConcurrentHashMap to store key-value pairs with thread safety considerations.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

6. #### Process a Collection using Stream API and Custom Comparator
- Choose a collection of data (e.g., list of objects).
- Implement a custom comparator to sort the collection based on specific criteria.
- Utilize the Stream API to filter, transform, and process elements within the sorted collection.

### Exception Handling in Java: Advanced Concepts

1. #### Handling Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
- Create methods that throw both checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Implement try-catch blocks to handle these exceptions appropriately, demonstrating the difference in handling requirements.

2. #### Utilizing Nested Try-Catch Blocks
- Simulate a scenario where you might need to handle multiple exceptions within nested code blocks.
- Implement nested try-catch blocks to catch specific exceptions at different levels of your code.
- [./IL-Week-1/README.md](./IL-Week-1/README.md)

3. #### Releasing Resources with finally Block

4. #### Creating a Custom Exception
