## Design Patterns: Mastering the Art of Reusable Object-Oriented Solutions 
- Creational Patterns:
    - `Singleton`
        - Implement a Singleton class for a Logger that ensures only one instance exists and provides methods for writing log messages.
        - [Solution - ./week2/README.md ](./week2/README.md)
    - `Factory Method`
        - Design a Factory class that can create different types of Shape objects (e.g., Circle, Square) based on the provided type.

    - `Abstract Factory`
        - Implement an Abstract Factory that can create families of UI components (e.g., Button, Checkbox) for Windows and MacOS platforms.

- Structural Patterns:
    - `Adapter`
        - Create an Adapter class that allows you to use a legacy payment processing library with a modern API.
    - `Facade`
        - Develop a Facade class for a complex e-commerce order processing system, offering simplified methods for placing and managing orders.
- Behavioral Patterns:
    - `Strategy`: Design a Strategy interface for sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort) and implement concrete classes for each algorithm.
    - `Observer`
    - `Template`
